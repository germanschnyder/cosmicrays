COMMENT * At the annual HST archive coordination meeting in 2003, CADC, ST-ECF, 
COMMENT * and STScI decided to generate an homogeneous set of calibrated        
COMMENT * FOC and GHRS observations.

COMMENT * The motivations were twofold. First, no more calibration activities   
COMMENT * were occurring for these instruments, nor from the instrument science,
COMMENT * nor from the calibration software point of view.                      
COMMENT * Second, the necessary expertise to operate a complex on-the-fly based 
COMMENT * archive and to support the scientific community was quickly declining 
COMMENT * for the HST heritage instruments, with the jeopardy of losing the     
COMMENT * capability of re-calibrating the data in the near future.             
COMMENT *                                                                       
COMMENT * This calibrated file was produced with the best software and          
COMMENT * calibration files available in September 2006. A careful check        
COMMENT * of the final products was performed, although it was not possible     
COMMENT * to check all datasets individually.                                   
COMMENT *                                                                       
COMMENT * The CADC, STScI and ST-ECF are pleased to make version 1.0 of         
COMMENT * these homogeneously re-calibrated files available to the community.
